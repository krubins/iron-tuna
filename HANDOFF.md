# Iron Tuna — Project Handoff

Fantasy-football auction draft assistant. Live at **https://irontuna.com**.
This document is everything you need to pick the project up in Claude Code (or any editor).

---

## 1. Repository & branch

- **Repo:** https://github.com/krubins/iron-tuna
- **Work from branch:** `main` (single active branch; deploys come from `main`).
- **Clone:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/krubins/iron-tuna.git
  cd iron-tuna
  ```
- As of this handoff, `main` HEAD is `0a9f0ab` ("Cheatsheet: wrap Show toggles to next line, remove Reset ranks") plus this `HANDOFF.md` commit. The working tree is clean and fully pushed — nothing is local-only.

---

## 2. Stack

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| Frontend | A **single file, `index.html`** (~1.1 MB). React + ReactDOM loaded from CDN. The app script is **pre-compiled JS** (`<script type="module">`, `React.createElement` calls — no in-browser Babel anymore). **`index.html` is the authoritative, deployed file — edit it directly.** |

> **⚠️ `app.source.html` is a STALE partial JSX copy — do NOT "rebuild" `index.html` from it.**
> It has drifted badly since the repo import: it completely lacks the snake-draft hub
> (`HubLanding`), `MockSnakeDraft`, `WillHeBeThere`, the full 18-week `SCHEDULE_2026` +
> `FullScheduleModal` (commit `007eba0` touched only `index.html`), `playerJabs`/`playerNews`,
> best-ball support, `AffiliatePortal`, the `iron_tuna_values_v1` snapshot writer,
> the projections re-baseline prompt, `healRosterPositions`, and more (~35 top-level
> symbols). Compiling it would silently delete all of those shipped features.
> Either regenerate it from the current build or delete it; until then treat `index.html`
> as the single source of truth and mirror fixes into `app.source.html` only opportunistically. |
| Styling | One inline `<style>` block in `index.html` (starts at **line 35**). No Tailwind, no CSS modules, no preprocessor. |
| Backend | **`_worker.js`** — a Cloudflare Worker that (a) serves the static files and (b) proxies two API routes: `/api/coach` (LLM "Gameday Navigator") and `/api/projections` (player projection data kept server-side). |
| Data | Authoritative player projections live **inside `_worker.js`** (lightly obfuscated) and are fetched at runtime; `index.html` carries a client-side fallback/last-year stat-line remap. |

**There is no build step and no package manager.** No `package.json`, no `node_modules`, no bundler. The "build" is literally "serve these static files." React/Babel do their work client-side. (A `package.json` line appears in `.assetsignore` defensively, but none exists in the repo.)

---

## 3. Run it locally

Because there's no build, any static file server works. Two good options:

```bash
# Option A — quickest, frontend only (no /api/* routes):
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080

# Option B — full fidelity, includes the Worker + /api routes:
npm install -g wrangler        # one-time, if not installed
wrangler dev                   # uses wrangler.jsonc; serves _worker.js + assets
# then open the URL wrangler prints (usually http://localhost:8787)
```

- Use **Option B** whenever you're testing the AI coach or projections, since those need the Worker. You'll need `LLM_API_KEY` in your environment for the coach to return real responses (see §5); the rest of the app works without it.
- **Install command:** none required for the app itself; only `npm install -g wrangler` if you want the Worker locally.
- **Dev command:** `wrangler dev` (full) or `python3 -m http.server 8080` (frontend only).

### Editing & sanity-checking
Edit `index.html` directly (in Claude Code the old size constraints don't apply). The app script is plain pre-compiled JS now, so before deploying, **always confirm it still parses** — a single bad escape silently white-screens the app:

```bash
node -e 'const fs=require("fs");
const h=fs.readFileSync("index.html","utf8");
const m=h.match(/<script type="module">([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/);
new Function(m[1]);
console.log("PARSE OK");'
```

Also beware the escape-corruption bug class that has bitten this repo three times: a `\n` or `\b`
written into a file as the *literal control byte* instead of backslash-n / backslash-b (a regex
containing a real newline is a SyntaxError that kills the whole page's script; a real backspace
byte inside a regex silently never matches). If a regex looks right but a page is dead or a match
never fires, hexdump the line.

---

## 4. How it deploys to Cloudflare

- **Project type:** Cloudflare **Pages, advanced mode** (a single `_worker.js` handles both asset serving and the API). The `_worker.js` header and the `pages.dev` references confirm Pages; `wrangler.jsonc` also lets you deploy/run it Workers-style. Confirm which surface is wired in the dashboard the first time — they share the same `_worker.js`.
- **Cloudflare project name:** `iron-tuna` (from `wrangler.jsonc` `"name": "iron-tuna"`).
- **Deploy trigger:** pushing to `main` on GitHub. Cloudflare's Git integration rebuilds automatically (typically live within ~1 minute). *(Until now, commits were made via the GitHub web "upload file" UI because the sandbox had no push credentials. In Claude Code with your Git auth, just `git add/commit/push` — that's the intended path and it triggers the same deploy.)*
- **Build command:** none (static — leave blank).
- **Output / publish directory:** repository **root** (`.`). `wrangler.jsonc` sets `"assets": { "directory": ".", "binding": "ASSETS", "run_worker_first": true }`.
- **`.assetsignore`** keeps infra files (`_worker.js`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `.assetsignore`, etc.) from being served as public static assets.
- **`wrangler.jsonc`** (the build/runtime config):
  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "iron-tuna",
    "main": "_worker.js",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-05-01",
    "assets": { "directory": ".", "binding": "ASSETS", "run_worker_first": true },
    "vars": { "LLM_PROVIDER": "anthropic", "LLM_MODEL": "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
  }
  ```
  Manual deploy alternative: `wrangler deploy`.

---

## 5. Environment variables & secrets

Set these in the **Cloudflare dashboard → the `iron-tuna` project → Settings → Environment variables / Secrets**. Non-secret defaults also live in `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`. **Names only below — values are not in the repo and must not be committed.**

| Name | Required | Secret? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | **Yes** | **Yes (encrypt)** | Anthropic `sk-ant-…` or OpenAI `sk-…`. Powers `/api/coach`. The app runs without it, but the AI coach returns a "missing key" error. |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | No | `"anthropic"` (current default, in `wrangler.jsonc`) or `"openai"`. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | No | Defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (in `wrangler.jsonc`). |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | No | No | Comma-separated origins to lock the proxy to your site. |
| `LLM_ENDPOINT` | No | No | Override for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | No | Yes | If set, `/api/coach` requires a Cloudflare Turnstile token. |
| `RATE_KV` | No | n/a (binding) | Optional KV namespace binding for per-IP rate limiting on the coach route. |

No `.env` file is used in production; everything is configured in Cloudflare. For local `wrangler dev`, export `LLM_API_KEY` in your shell or use a `.dev.vars` file (git-ignored).

---

## 6. Where the key markup lives (all in `index.html`)

- **Global CSS:** the single `<style>` block beginning at **line 35**. To add a stylesheet "after global CSS so its tokens win," append a second `<style>` (or a `<link>`) immediately after that block, or paste rules at its end.
- **Landing/hero component render:** around **line 2276** (`<div className="landing-splash landing-page …">`). The hero proper is `.lp-hero`; hero CSS is around lines **943–965**.
- **The three value boxes (market price / true value / your max bid):** these are the **PROJ / VALUE / YOU** columns, shown in the mock-screenshot `.lp-shot` block (`.lp-shot-row`, CSS lines **1015–1029**) and explained in the caption near **line 2333**.
- **Primary call-to-action button:** `.lp-cta` — "Get my auction values" at **line 2295** (CSS at line **959**).
- **App scoring/value engine:** functions `scorePlayer` / `scoreSkillPlayer` / `scoreKicker` / `scoreDefense`, plus `applyQbActuals` (remaps each position's projected line to last year's actual line **by projected rank**), `applyBaselineRankFixes`, and `applyCustomRanks`, all feeding the `baseValued` memo.
- **User state:** all per-user customization (ranks, price overrides, scoring config, targets) is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under `iron_tuna_draft_state_v2`. Nothing a user does on the site touches the repo or other users — see §7.

---

## 7. Half-finished / fragile things to know

- **Pending: "layered dark hero" treatment.** You asked to apply `irontuna-hero-dark.css` and add class hooks `it-hero` (hero container), `it-card` (three value boxes) + `it-card--accent` (true-value box only), and `it-btn` (primary CTA), with page background `#0a0b0d`. **This is not done** — the CSS file never made it through the upload, so no `it-*` classes exist yet. Re-attach the file to finish it. (Constraints you set: keep the glow subtle — don't raise alpha in `.it-hero::before` or the button shadow; keep the accent teal via `--it-accent-rgb`.)
- **In-browser Babel = silent failures.** A JSX typo or a stray `\u` escape in a **text node** (renders literally) will white-screen the whole app with no error. Always run the compile check in §3 before pushing. Note `\u` escapes resolve fine inside JS expressions but NOT in JSX text — use the real character there.
- **One giant file.** `index.html` holds the entire UI as JSX-in-a-script. It's ~553 KB / ~6,900 lines. Search by the line references in §6; consider it a candidate for future modularization, but the in-browser-Babel setup means there's no bundler to split it today.
- **Projections exist in two places.** Server-authoritative copy in `_worker.js` (`/api/projections`, obfuscated) and a client copy/remap in `index.html`. If you change projection numbers, check whether you need to update both.
- **Default-scoring changes only affect new/cleared users.** Because state is cached in `localStorage`, anyone with a saved session won't see changes to *default* scoring until they reset or clear storage.
- **Deploy latency.** After a push, Cloudflare takes up to ~a minute to rebuild; hard-refresh (or append `?v=…`) to bypass cache when verifying.

## 8. The 2026 Insights system (added July 2026)

The 220-insight research set (auction/snake/best ball) is split three ways and is **fully self-publishing** — no manual action needed for releases:

- **70 public** — pre-built as 42 static drop pages, one per format per date (`auction-insights-YYYY-MM-DD.html`, `snake-insights-…`, `bestball-insights-…`): July 4 launch, Thursdays in July, Mondays + Thursdays Aug 6 – Sep 3. The first four drops carry the hand-curated 20 strongest takes. Pages are article-style: no CTA above the content; the premium band sits at the bottom. `_worker.js` 302-redirects any future-dated drop page to its format index until **9:00am ET (13:00 UTC)** on its date (2026-07-04 is exempted as the launch drop), 301s legacy `/insights-YYYY-MM-DD` URLs to the auction edition, and filters unreleased URLs out of `sitemap.xml` on the fly. `/insights` is the format-chooser hub; `/auction-insights`, `/snake-insights`, `/bestball-insights` are the per-format indexes (future drops hidden client-side). Nothing to do on release days.
- **30 vault** — email-gated on `/insights-vault`. `POST /api/insights-vault` validates the email, stores it via `saveContact` (D1 `contacts`, source `insights-vault`, also fires `LEAD_WEBHOOK`), and returns the vault JSON. (Vault copy upgraded July 2026: each insight's auction/snake/best-ball action lines are now three genuinely format-specific calls instead of one repeated sentence, and all bodies are em-dash-free.) Emails export via the existing `/api/leads/export?key=…`.
- **150 premium** (complete: the original 120 plus 30 news-reactive additions authored July 2026 from the Auction Watch corpus) — embedded in `_worker.js` as `INSIGHTS_PREMIUM`, served XOR+base64 from `GET /api/insights` (same `IT_KEY`/referer pattern as `/api/projections`). Read UI: `/my-insights` (checks localStorage entitlements, falls back to `/api/auth/me`).

Regeneration pipeline (source docs → all pages/data) lives in the session scratchpad scripts `build_insights.py` + `gen_pages.py`; the partition (which insight is public/vault/premium and which drop date) is `insights_partition.json`. To add the next 30 insights: parse them with the same field schema, append to `INSIGHTS_PREMIUM` (or swap 10 into future drop pages), and refresh `_INS_ENC` is automatic (memo re-encodes per isolate).

## 9. Daily projections-update routine (added July 2026)

A scheduled Claude session runs daily to refresh player projections:

1. The agent fetches season-long projections from **ESPN, SportsLine, and NFL.com** and verifies each source's projections were published within the **preceding 7 days** (stale or undated sources are excluded).
2. Fresh sources are written to `tools/sources/<source>.json` (schema documented at the top of `tools/merge-projections.mjs`).
3. `node tools/merge-projections.mjs` merges them: multi-source stats are **averaged**, players are matched by normalized name+position against the existing `PROJECTIONS` roster (no adds/removes), and hard sanity checks abort on any anomaly (count change, NaN, implausible leaders, <25 matches, worker parse failure). Zero fresh sources → exit 2, no changes.
**League tailoring:** the app persists a compact sheet snapshot to localStorage (`iron_tuna_values_v1`: name/pos/$value/points + teams/budget/format) whenever `baseValued` recomputes. `/my-insights` reads it and translates each premium insight's percentage effect into the buyer's units — auction: dollars against the player's sheet price; snake/best ball: draft slots (and rounds) by re-ranking the snapshot. No snapshot → generic percentages plus a set-up-your-league hint.

4. On success it bumps `PROJ_VERSION` in `index.html` (date-stamped). Users with saved state re-baseline on next load; users who **reordered rankings** get an in-app prompt — "Use updated rankings" (clears `rankOrder`) or "Keep my reorder" (overlay persists on the new numbers).
5. The agent commits and pushes to `main` (Cloudflare auto-deploys).

Fail-safe: if fetching is blocked (environment network policy) or all sources are stale, the day is skipped with no repo changes. `tools/` is in `.assetsignore` so it never serves publicly.

## 10. X (Twitter) auto-post (added July 2026)

Posts to **@irontunafantasy** every **weekday at 14:00 UTC** (10am ET / 9am during EST) — one auction insight + one snake insight per run, **plus a third bonus post Tue-Fri**: Wednesday alternates auction money-allocation strategy and Value Coach promos, Tuesday+Thursday post snake-draft "survival odds" feature promos, and Friday (much lower volume, by design, best ball is a separate niche format) sprinkles in best-ball insights and ceiling/stack/championship-week feature promos. Runs via a Cloudflare Worker **Cron Trigger**, no external scheduler needed.

**Style rule: no em dashes in any hand-authored post content, on X, Reddit, or any other platform this system ever posts to.** Use a period, comma, or colon instead depending on what the em dash was doing. This applies only to hand-authored text (`X_STRATEGY_POSTS`, `X_COACH_POSTS`, `X_COMPARISON_*_POSTS`, `X_SNAKE_FEATURE_POSTS`, `X_BESTBALL_FEATURE_POSTS`, their per-post `cta` reply lines, `X_TAGLINE`, `X_WED_TAGLINE`, and the `INSIGHTS_VAULT` copy) — extracted insight titles/takeaways (`INSIGHTS_X_POOL`) happen not to contain any today, but if a future drop page does, re-run the extractor's `capRatio`-style guard logic (or a similar filter) rather than assuming it's clean.

**How it works:**
- `INSIGHTS_X_POOL` in `_worker.js` is a flat array of `{id, format, title, play, stat, url, date}` extracted from the public `auction-insights-*.html` / `snake-insights-*.html` / `bestball-insights-*.html` drop pages (210 insights: 70 each of auction, snake, bestball). `play` is the insight-specific half of its "The play:" line (the generic strategy sentence is stripped, keeping just the actionable verdict); `stat` is the page's quantified "Projected effect:" statline (em dashes converted to commas, word-boundary-capped at ~110 chars; 201/210 insights have one). Regenerate with `node tools/extract-insight-pool.mjs` whenever new drop pages are added, then paste the resulting `tools/x-posts/insights_pool.json` back into the `const INSIGHTS_X_POOL = [...]` line in `_worker.js` (no build step, so this is manual — see §2). The extractor drops `play` to `''` if it detects leaked non-prose content (a data-quality guard against the couple of source pages where table markup bled into a `<p class="playline">`).
- `composeThread(insight)` builds a **2-tweet thread**, not a single tweet, so real analysis fits: tweet 1 is `🏈 {title}` + `📊 Projected effect: {stat}` + `💡 {play takeaway}` — the stat line is included whenever the full trio fits in 280 (198/210 currently) and silently dropped otherwise, never truncated mid-number; the title takes whatever room the play line doesn't need and every current title+play pair fits untruncated; tweet 2 is a reply opening **"Insight N of 5 in this drop."** (N parsed from the insight id — sells the click by promising four more takes AND makes each reply's text unique, since the five insights on one drop page share a URL and X permanently rejects exact-duplicate tweets) + `X_TAGLINE` + the insight's canonical URL + format-specific hashtags (`#FantasyFootball #AuctionDraft #FFDraft` or `#FantasyFootball #SnakeDraft #FFDraft`). Max observed length across the full pool: 268 chars (tweet 1) / 218 chars (tweet 2), both under 280 (verified programmatically across all 315 composable threads, July 2026 rewrite).
- `runXAutoPost(env)` picks the next auction insight and next snake insight by rotation index (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM x_posts WHERE format=?`), so all 70 insights per format post once before any repeat. Only insights whose page `date` has already unlocked (≤ today) are eligible. If the two picks happen to share the same headline (the public drop pages occasionally cover the same player from both formats), the snake pick is bumped to the next index so the two posts never look like accidental duplicates.
- `postThread(env, tweets)` posts tweet 1, then tweet 2 as a reply via `in_reply_to_tweet_id`, using `postTweet(env, text, replyToId)` → **OAuth 1.0a** (HMAC-SHA1) signed `POST https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets`, since free/basic X API tiers only support posting via OAuth 1.0a user context, not app-only bearer tokens.
- `scheduled(event, env, ctx)` at the bottom of `_worker.js` calls `runXAutoPost(env)`, which posts both formats' threads and logs each attempt to a D1 table `x_posts (insight_id, format, tweet_id, ok, posted_at)` — `tweet_id` is a comma-joined pair (hook,reply) when both post successfully.
- **Tue-Fri bonus third post:** `X_BONUS_DAY_POOLS` maps UTC day-of-week → `{pool, compose, format}` (or `{dynamicPool, compose, format}` for Friday — see below).
  - **Wednesday** (day 3) uses `X_WEDNESDAY_POOL`, a 4-way interleave of: `X_MOCK_AUCTION_POSTS` (5 tweets promoting the free email-gated Mock Auction — mock snake drafts are commodity, a real practice auction room is rare; claims grounded in the `MockAuction` component: 11 CPU managers with distinct strategy archetypes, auto-nomination, second-price winning, the user's own league config, final standings by projected starter points), `X_STRATEGY_POSTS` (8 tweets on auction budget allocation — position spend %, stars-and-scrubs vs balanced, nomination timing, the $1 endgame/handcuffs — grounded in `/auction-budget-allocation`, `/auction-nomination-strategy`, `/dollar-endgame-handcuffs`), `X_COACH_POSTS` (7 tweets promoting the live AI Value Coach — "an AI that's actually in your draft" vs. pasting your roster into a generic chatbot), and `X_COMPARISON_AUCTION_POSTS` (4 tweets contrasting Iron Tuna's one-time $9.99 + live re-pricing + Value Coach against free-but-static default host draft kits (ESPN/Yahoo) and paid monthly ranking subscriptions like FantasyPros MVP, $5.99+/mo).
  - **Tuesday and Thursday** (days 2 and 4) both use `X_SNAKE_BONUS_POOL`, a 2-way interleave of `X_SNAKE_FEATURE_POSTS` (8 tweets promoting the live survival-odds / "Will he be available?" feature — knowing who'll last to round 5 changes what you take in round 2) and `X_COMPARISON_SNAKE_POSTS` (4 tweets contrasting the same live survival-odds/Value Coach/pricing angle against free static draft rooms (Sleeper/ESPN) and paid subscription rankers). Both days share one rotation counter (format `snakefeature`), so Tue and Thu together cycle through all 12 without repeating.
  - **Friday** (day 5) is intentionally the lightest — best ball is a smaller, separate audience, not something to post about as often as auction/snake. `X_BONUS_DAY_POOLS[5].dynamicPool()` interleaves `poolFor('bestball')` (real extracted best-ball insights, same date-gating as auction/snake — only 10 eligible as of this writing, growing as more drop pages unlock) with the 4 hand-authored `X_BESTBALL_FEATURE_POSTS` (ceiling-weighted values, live stack alerts the moment you draft a QB, championship-week (15-17) schedule weighting, "a dedicated tool, not a reskin" — grounded in `/bestball` and `/best-ball-stacking-guide`). It's called `dynamicPool()` rather than a static array (unlike the other two days) specifically so newly unlocked best-ball drop pages become eligible the moment their gate passes, not just at the next deploy. `composeBestballThread(item)` dispatches between `composeThread` (extracted insights — detected by the presence of a `play` key) and `composeBonusThread` (hand-authored posts) since the two shapes need different composers.
  - `runXAutoPost` looks up `X_BONUS_DAY_POOLS[dayOfWeek]` and, if present, posts one additional thread from that day's pool via `composeBonusThread(post, hashtags)` (each post's own `cta` line leads the reply, falling back to `X_WED_TAGLINE` if absent — per-post CTAs keep the reply copy matched to the hook and keep every reply's text unique across posts that share a landing URL, avoiding X's permanent duplicate-content rejection; day-specific hashtags — `#...AuctionDraft...` for Wednesday, `#...SnakeDraft...` for Tue/Thu, `#...BestBall...` for Friday). To test any day's bonus post outside its real weekday, call the manual trigger with `&day=<0-6>` (0=Sun..6=Sat, matches cron numbering) — `&wednesday=1` still works as shorthand for `&day=3`.
  - Competitor pricing referenced in the comparison posts (FantasyPros MVP ~$5.99/mo) was spot-checked via web search at authoring time (July 2026) — re-verify before reusing if it's been a while, since subscription pricing changes.
- **Model-derived stats in hand-authored posts:** the numbers quoted in the bonus-post copy (88 players above replacement, 60%/76% top-24/36 value share, 86% RB+WR share, QB5→QB12 = 0.7 PPG, RB12→RB24 = 3.1 vs WR12→WR24 = 1.9 PPG, RB18→RB30 = 3.3 PPG, 11 RBs outside the top 30 at 150+ pts, 53% top-2 pass-catcher share, and the survival-odds examples 17%/3%/74%/6%) are all computed from the live `PROJECTIONS` data + the site's actual survival formula by `node tools/compute-tweet-stats.mjs`. Re-run it after major projection updates; if a quoted number drifts meaningfully, update the tweet copy to match.
- **Football facts in hand-authored posts (Berry-style, added July 2026):** roughly half the bonus posts lead with a specific 2026 football fact — coordinator/coach changes (Petzing to Detroit + Campbell's Gibbs "bellcow" quote, Coen's Jacksonville rotation), personnel moves (49ers signing Evans + Kirk, A.J. Brown to New England, Dowdle's 2-yr/$12.25M deal burying Kaleb Johnson, Kyler Murray released, Stevenson/Henderson split), injuries (Mahomes ACL rehab, Bucky Irving "summer or fall", Garrett Wilson full participant), weather/schedule (Lambeau late-season snow flags vs BUF/MIA/HOU, the Rams' hard closing slate), and usage stats (Daniels 685.9 rush yds in 7 games, JSN 35.7% target share on 162 targets, Pickens' deep-role spike profile). **Every one of these is sourced from this repo's own drop pages / Auction Watch pages / `INSIGHTS_VAULT` — never from memory.** Two maintenance rules: (1) when adding facts, grep the corpus first and quote it exactly; (2) several facts are dated news (injury timelines, camp status) — re-skim the fact-led posts when new Auction Watch pages contradict them (e.g. once Irving is cleared, that compare-auction-0 line needs refreshing) and at minimum once before each season phase (camp open, cutdowns, Week 1).
- **Comparison-card graphics:** the 8 `compare-*` posts (both auction and snake pools) each carry an `image` field pointing at `/social/compare-auction.png` or `/social/compare-snake.png` — two dark-themed comparison-table cards (1200×675 @2x) built to match the site's existing palette (`--bg`/`--panel`/`--teal`/`--gold`/`--danger` tokens from the guide pages), each showing a 4-row Iron Tuna-vs-2-competitors table (price + 3 feature rows) with a `$9.99 one-time` / `Free to start` price tag. Source template + generator script (`template.html` + `build.mjs`, Playwright/Chromium screenshot) live in the session scratchpad, not the repo — regenerate by editing the row data in a copy of that script if the comparison content changes; the repo only keeps the rendered PNGs. `postAndLog()` uploads the image via X's v1.1 `/media/upload.json` (multipart, OAuth 1.0a — the only media endpoint X's API still exposes) and attaches it to just the first tweet of the thread via `media.media_ids` on the v2 `/2/tweets` call; the reply tweet stays text-only. Only the `wednesday`/`snakefeature` bonus posts carry images — the daily auction/snake insight threads don't.
- **Manual trigger for testing:** `GET /api/admin/x-post-now?key=<LEADS_EXPORT_KEY>` runs the same `runXAutoPost` on demand and returns the composed thread text + tweet IDs — use this to verify before waiting for the next cron tick. Add `&day=2` (Tue), `&day=3` (Wed), or `&day=4` (Thu) to force that day's bonus post on an off-day test run.
- **Manual delete (cleanup):** `GET /api/admin/x-delete?key=<LEADS_EXPORT_KEY>&id=<tweet_id>` deletes a single tweet by ID via OAuth 1.0a `DELETE /2/tweets/:id` — useful for removing a bad test post.
- **Spend tracking:** X's pay-per-use pricing (as of July 2026) is $0.015 per plain post, $0.20 per post containing a link — a 13x jump, and every reply tweet in our threads carries the irontuna.com link, so that dominates cost. `tweetCost(text)` estimates per-tweet cost by checking for a URL; `postAndLog()` sums it across the thread's actually-created tweets (a rejected duplicate is never charged) and stores it in `x_posts.est_cost` (`ALTER TABLE x_posts ADD COLUMN est_cost REAL`). `GET /api/admin/x-spend?key=<LEADS_EXPORT_KEY>` returns total estimated spend and a per-format breakdown; add `&balance=25` (or whatever the current real balance is) to also get `estimatedRemaining`. This is an estimate for budget awareness, not authoritative billing — always cross-check the X developer console's Credits page for the real number.
- **Duplicate-text guard:** X rejects (`403 duplicate content`) any tweet whose text exactly matches one already posted from the account — forever, not just same-day. This isn't rare: several early drop dates republish the exact same title+takeaway across auction/snake/bestball with only the URL differing, since it's the same underlying research. `x_posts.text_hash` (SHA-256 of the hook tweet, added after the table's initial creation — `ALTER TABLE x_posts ADD COLUMN text_hash TEXT`) records every successful post; `pickNonDuplicate()` walks the rotation forward past any pool item whose composed text already has a matching hash before posting, and now returns `null` (skip the slot, no API call) rather than attempting a guaranteed-to-fail repost if the whole currently-eligible pool is exhausted — this can genuinely happen early on, when only 1-2 drop dates are unlocked and heavy manual testing (or, less likely, real daily posting outrunning the drop-date cadence) burns through the small shared pool before the next date unlocks. It self-resolves as more drop pages become eligible. Applies to all pools (auction, snake, wednesday, snakefeature, bestball).

**One-time setup required (not yet done as of this handoff):**

1. **Create an X Developer app for @irontunafantasy** at [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com) (a paid API tier is required for write access on current X API pricing — check current tier pricing before committing). Enable **OAuth 1.0a** with **Read and Write** permissions, and generate:
   - API Key & Secret (`X_API_KEY` / `X_API_SECRET`)
   - Access Token & Secret **for the @irontunafantasy account specifically** (`X_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) — regenerate these after setting Read+Write, since tokens generated before that change stay read-only.
2. **Add all four as Cloudflare secrets** on the `iron-tuna` Worker (`wrangler secret put X_API_KEY`, etc., or via the dashboard → Settings → Variables and Secrets → encrypt).
3. **Create the `x_posts` D1 table** (already run against `iron-tuna-leads` as of this handoff — included here for reference / disaster recovery):
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS x_posts (
     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     insight_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     format TEXT NOT NULL,
     tweet_id TEXT,
     ok INTEGER NOT NULL,
     posted_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     text_hash TEXT
   );
   ```
   Run via `wrangler d1 execute iron-tuna-leads --remote --command "..."` (the SQL above) or the Cloudflare dashboard's D1 console.
4. **Deploy** (`git push` to `main`, or `wrangler deploy` — the cron trigger only takes effect after a deploy since it's declared in `wrangler.jsonc`).
5. **Verify** with the manual-trigger route above before trusting the schedule.

**Notes:**
- If the four `X_*` secrets aren't set, `runXAutoPost` returns `{ok:false, error:'missing_x_credentials'}` and posts nothing — safe to deploy before the X app is ready.
- To change cadence/time, edit the `triggers.crons` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`; to change hashtags/tagline, edit `X_TAGLINE` / `X_HASHTAGS` in `_worker.js`.
- To draw from the 150-insight premium set instead of the public 70, a teaser/truncation strategy would be needed (premium content is currently paywalled behind `/my-insights`) — not implemented, by design, so free X posts don't give away paid-tier value.

## 11. Threads auto-post (added July 2026)

Mirrors whatever `runXAutoPost` posts to X onto **Threads** (@irontunafantasy, once created) the same run, same content — not a second independent rotation. Fires from the same `scheduled()` cron as X, so no separate trigger is needed. Free API (no per-post charge, unlike X's pay-per-use pricing), 500-char limit (well above anything this system composes), and images post via a plain public URL instead of a separate media-upload step.

**How it works:**
- `postAndLogThreads(env, format, id, tweets, imagePath)` is called right after each successful (or skipped) X post, using the exact same `pick.tweets` array X just composed — so the two platforms carry the same message the same day. If X's pool is exhausted for a slot (`no_insight_available`), Threads is skipped too for that slot, same as X.
- **2-step publish** (Meta's Threads API pattern, same shape as Instagram's Graph API): `createThreadsContainer` (`POST /{THREADS_USER_ID}/threads` with `media_type`, `text`, optional `image_url`/`reply_to_id`) returns a `creation_id`; `publishThreadsContainer` (`POST /{THREADS_USER_ID}/threads_publish` with that `creation_id`) actually publishes it. `postThreadsThread` chains a 2-post thread via `reply_to_id`, same hook+reply structure as X.
- **Images** use `media_type=IMAGE` + `image_url` pointing straight at `https://irontuna.com/social/compare-*.png` — no upload step needed, unlike X's OAuth 1.0a multipart dance, since Threads accepts any publicly reachable URL.
- **Token refresh:** Threads long-lived access tokens expire in 60 days and **cannot be refreshed after they expire**, and a Cloudflare Worker cannot rewrite its own secret at runtime — so the live token is stored in a `threads_token` D1 table (seeded from the `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret on first use) rather than only living in the secret. `maybeRefreshThreadsToken(env)` runs before every post attempt, checks the stored token's `expires_at`, and calls Meta's `refresh_access_token` endpoint (which only needs the current valid token, no app secret) once it's within 10 days of expiring, writing the new token + expiry back to D1. As long as posting happens at least every ~50 days, this is fully self-maintaining.
- Logs to `threads_posts (insight_id, format, post_id, ok, posted_at)` — a separate table from `x_posts`, since Threads doesn't reject duplicate content the way X does, so there's no need for the hash-dedup machinery there.
- **Manual trigger:** the existing `GET /api/admin/x-post-now?key=...` now returns both platforms' results in one array (`"platform":"x"` / `"platform":"threads"` on each entry) — no separate endpoint needed.
- **Token health check:** `GET /api/admin/threads-status?key=<LEADS_EXPORT_KEY>` returns whether a refreshed token is stored in D1 yet, how many days until it expires, and when it was last refreshed.

**One-time setup required (not yet done as of this handoff):**
1. Create a **Meta Developer account + App** at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com), add the **Threads API** product to it.
2. Add **@irontunafantasy's Threads account** as the app's test user / connect it via the Threads Login flow, requesting scopes `threads_basic` and `threads_content_publish`.
3. Complete the OAuth flow once (Meta's Graph API Explorer in the app dashboard can generate a User Access Token directly with the right scopes, avoiding a manual redirect-URI dance) to get a **short-lived token**, then exchange it for a **long-lived token** via `GET https://graph.threads.net/access_token?grant_type=th_exchange_token&client_id=<app id>&client_secret=<app secret>&access_token=<short-lived token>` (a plain browser-navigable GET — paste the filled-in URL into a browser address bar and read the JSON response).
4. Get the account's numeric **Threads user ID** via `GET https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/me?fields=id,username&access_token=<token>`.
5. Add two Cloudflare secrets on the `iron-tuna` Worker: `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` (the long-lived token from step 3) and `THREADS_USER_ID` (from step 4).
6. Deploy, then verify with the manual trigger and check `/api/admin/threads-status` a few seconds later to confirm a refreshed token landed in D1.

**Notes:**
- If `THREADS_USER_ID` or a usable access token isn't set, `postAndLogThreads` returns `{ok:false, error:'missing_threads_credentials'}` and that result is silently dropped from the response (not treated as a failure) — safe to deploy before the Threads app is ready; X keeps posting on its own either way.
- Content reuses every pool already built for X verbatim (same em-dash-free style rule applies — see §10) — no separate Threads-specific content was authored, by design, to keep the two platforms in sync.
