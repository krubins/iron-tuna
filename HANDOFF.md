# Iron Tuna — Project Handoff

Fantasy-football auction draft assistant. Live at **https://irontuna.com**.
This document is everything you need to pick the project up in Claude Code (or any editor).

---

## 1. Repository & branch

- **Repo:** https://github.com/krubins/iron-tuna
- **Work from branch:** `main` (single active branch; deploys come from `main`).
- **Clone:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/krubins/iron-tuna.git
  cd iron-tuna
  ```
- As of this handoff, `main` HEAD is `0a9f0ab` ("Cheatsheet: wrap Show toggles to next line, remove Reset ranks") plus this `HANDOFF.md` commit. The working tree is clean and fully pushed — nothing is local-only.

---

## 2. Stack

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| Frontend | A **single file, `index.html`** (~553 KB). React + ReactDOM loaded from CDN, **compiled in the browser by Babel Standalone** (`<script type="text/babel" data-presets="react">`, classic runtime). |
| Styling | One inline `<style>` block in `index.html` (starts at **line 35**). No Tailwind, no CSS modules, no preprocessor. |
| Backend | **`_worker.js`** — a Cloudflare Worker that (a) serves the static files and (b) proxies two API routes: `/api/coach` (LLM "Gameday Navigator") and `/api/projections` (player projection data kept server-side). |
| Data | Authoritative player projections live **inside `_worker.js`** (lightly obfuscated) and are fetched at runtime; `index.html` carries a client-side fallback/last-year stat-line remap. |

**There is no build step and no package manager.** No `package.json`, no `node_modules`, no bundler. The "build" is literally "serve these static files." React/Babel do their work client-side. (A `package.json` line appears in `.assetsignore` defensively, but none exists in the repo.)

---

## 3. Run it locally

Because there's no build, any static file server works. Two good options:

```bash
# Option A — quickest, frontend only (no /api/* routes):
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080

# Option B — full fidelity, includes the Worker + /api routes:
npm install -g wrangler        # one-time, if not installed
wrangler dev                   # uses wrangler.jsonc; serves _worker.js + assets
# then open the URL wrangler prints (usually http://localhost:8787)
```

- Use **Option B** whenever you're testing the AI coach or projections, since those need the Worker. You'll need `LLM_API_KEY` in your environment for the coach to return real responses (see §5); the rest of the app works without it.
- **Install command:** none required for the app itself; only `npm install -g wrangler` if you want the Worker locally.
- **Dev command:** `wrangler dev` (full) or `python3 -m http.server 8080` (frontend only).

### Editing & sanity-checking
Edit `index.html` directly (in Claude Code the old size constraints don't apply). Before deploying, **always confirm the JSX still compiles** — a single bad escape silently white-screens the app:

```bash
node -e 'const b=require("@babel/core"),fs=require("fs");
const h=fs.readFileSync("index.html","utf8");
const m=h.match(/<script type="text\/babel"[^>]*>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/);
b.transformSync(m[1],{presets:[["@babel/preset-react",{runtime:"classic"}]]});
console.log("COMPILE OK");'
```

---

## 4. How it deploys to Cloudflare

- **Project type:** Cloudflare **Pages, advanced mode** (a single `_worker.js` handles both asset serving and the API). The `_worker.js` header and the `pages.dev` references confirm Pages; `wrangler.jsonc` also lets you deploy/run it Workers-style. Confirm which surface is wired in the dashboard the first time — they share the same `_worker.js`.
- **Cloudflare project name:** `iron-tuna` (from `wrangler.jsonc` `"name": "iron-tuna"`).
- **Deploy trigger:** pushing to `main` on GitHub. Cloudflare's Git integration rebuilds automatically (typically live within ~1 minute). *(Until now, commits were made via the GitHub web "upload file" UI because the sandbox had no push credentials. In Claude Code with your Git auth, just `git add/commit/push` — that's the intended path and it triggers the same deploy.)*
- **Build command:** none (static — leave blank).
- **Output / publish directory:** repository **root** (`.`). `wrangler.jsonc` sets `"assets": { "directory": ".", "binding": "ASSETS", "run_worker_first": true }`.
- **`.assetsignore`** keeps infra files (`_worker.js`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `.assetsignore`, etc.) from being served as public static assets.
- **`wrangler.jsonc`** (the build/runtime config):
  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "iron-tuna",
    "main": "_worker.js",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-05-01",
    "assets": { "directory": ".", "binding": "ASSETS", "run_worker_first": true },
    "vars": { "LLM_PROVIDER": "anthropic", "LLM_MODEL": "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
  }
  ```
  Manual deploy alternative: `wrangler deploy`.

---

## 5. Environment variables & secrets

Set these in the **Cloudflare dashboard → the `iron-tuna` project → Settings → Environment variables / Secrets**. Non-secret defaults also live in `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`. **Names only below — values are not in the repo and must not be committed.**

| Name | Required | Secret? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | **Yes** | **Yes (encrypt)** | Anthropic `sk-ant-…` or OpenAI `sk-…`. Powers `/api/coach`. The app runs without it, but the AI coach returns a "missing key" error. |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | No | `"anthropic"` (current default, in `wrangler.jsonc`) or `"openai"`. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | No | Defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (in `wrangler.jsonc`). |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | No | No | Comma-separated origins to lock the proxy to your site. |
| `LLM_ENDPOINT` | No | No | Override for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET` | No | Yes | If set, `/api/coach` requires a Cloudflare Turnstile token. |
| `RATE_KV` | No | n/a (binding) | Optional KV namespace binding for per-IP rate limiting on the coach route. |

No `.env` file is used in production; everything is configured in Cloudflare. For local `wrangler dev`, export `LLM_API_KEY` in your shell or use a `.dev.vars` file (git-ignored).

## 6. Where the key markup lives (all in `index.html`)

- **Global CSS:** the single `<style>` block beginning at **line 35**. To add a stylesheet "after global CSS so its tokens win," append a second `<style>` (or a `<link>`) immediately after that block, or paste rules at its end.
- **Landing/hero component render:** around **line 2276** (`<div className="landing-splash landing-page …">`). The hero proper is `.lp-hero`; hero CSS is around lines **943–965**.
- **The three value boxes (market price / true value / your max bid):** these are the **PROJ / VALUE / YOU** columns, shown in the mock-screenshot `.lp-shot` block (`.lp-shot-row`, CSS lines **1015–1029**) and explained in the caption near **line 2333**.
- **Primary call-to-action button:** `.lp-cta` — "Get my auction values" at **line 2295** (CSS at line **959**).
- **App scoring/value engine:** functions `scorePlayer` / `scoreSkillPlayer` / `scoreKicker` / `scoreDefense`, plus `applyQbActuals` (remaps each position's projected line to last year's actual line **by projected rank**), `applyBaselineRankFixes`, and `applyCustomRanks`, all feeding the `baseValued` memo.
- **User state:** all per-user customization (ranks, price overrides, scoring config, targets) is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under `iron_tuna_draft_state_v2`. Nothing a user does on the site touches the repo or other users — see §7.

---

## 7. Half-finished / fragile things to know

- **Pending: "layered dark hero" treatment.** You asked to apply `irontuna-hero-dark.css` and add class hooks `it-hero` (hero container), `it-card` (three value boxes) + `it-card--accent` (true-value box only), and `it-btn` (primary CTA), with page background `#0a0b0d`. **This is not done** — the CSS file never made it through the upload, so no `it-*` classes exist yet. Re-attach the file to finish it. (Constraints you set: keep the glow subtle — don't raise alpha in `.it-hero::before` or the button shadow; keep the accent teal via `--it-accent-rgb`.)
- **In-browser Babel = silent failures.** A JSX typo or a stray `\u` escape in a **text node** (renders literally) will white-screen the whole app with no error. Always run the compile check in §3 before pushing. Note `\u` escapes resolve fine inside JS expressions but NOT in JSX text — use the real character there.
- **One giant file.** `index.html` holds the entire UI as JSX-in-a-script. It's ~553 KB / ~6,900 lines. Search by the line references in §6; consider it a candidate for future modularization, but the in-browser-Babel setup means there's no bundler to split it today.
- **Projections exist in two places.** Server-authoritative copy in `_worker.js` (`/api/projections`, obfuscated) and a client copy/remap in `index.html`. If you change projection numbers, check whether you need to update both.
- **Default-scoring changes only affect new/cleared users.** Because state is cached in `localStorage`, anyone with a saved session won't see changes to *default* scoring until they reset or clear storage.
- **Deploy latency.** After a push, Cloudflare takes up to ~a minute to rebuild; hard-refresh (or append `?v=…`) to bypass cache when verifying.

## 8. The 2026 Insights system (added July 2026)

The 220-insight research set (auction/snake/best ball) is split three ways and is **fully self-publishing** — no manual action needed for releases:

- **70 public** — pre-built as 42 static drop pages, one per format per date (`auction-insights-YYYY-MM-DD.html`, `snake-insights-…`, `bestball-insights-…`): July 4 launch, Thursdays in July, Mondays + Thursdays Aug 6 – Sep 3. The first four drops carry the hand-curated 20 strongest takes. Pages are article-style: no CTA above the content; the premium band sits at the bottom. `_worker.js` 302-redirects any future-dated drop page to its format index until **9:00am ET (13:00 UTC)** on its date (2026-07-04 is exempted as the launch drop), 301s legacy `/insights-YYYY-MM-DD` URLs to the auction edition, and filters unreleased URLs out of `sitemap.xml` on the fly. `/insights` is the format-chooser hub; `/auction-insights`, `/snake-insights`, `/bestball-insights` are the per-format indexes (future drops hidden client-side). Nothing to do on release days.
- **30 vault** — email-gated on `/insights-vault`. `POST /api/insights-vault` validates the email, stores it via `saveContact` (D1 `contacts`, source `insights-vault`, also fires `LEAD_WEBHOOK`), and returns the vault JSON. Emails export via the existing `/api/leads/export?key=…`.
- **150 premium** (complete: the original 120 plus 30 news-reactive additions authored July 2026 from the Auction Watch corpus) — embedded in `_worker.js` as `INSIGHTS_PREMIUM`, served XOR+base64 from `GET /api/insights` (same `IT_KEY`/referer pattern as `/api/projections`). Read UI: `/my-insights` (checks localStorage entitlements, falls back to `/api/auth/me`).

Regeneration pipeline (source docs → all pages/data) lives in the session scratchpad scripts `build_insights.py` + `gen_pages.py`; the partition (which insight is public/vault/premium and which drop date) is `insights_partition.json`. To add the next 30 insights: parse them with the same field schema, append to `INSIGHTS_PREMIUM` (or swap 10 into future drop pages), and refresh `_INS_ENC` is automatic (memo re-encodes per isolate).

## 9. Daily projections-update routine (added July 2026)

A scheduled Claude session runs daily to refresh player projections:

1. The agent fetches season-long projections from **ESPN, SportsLine, and NFL.com** and verifies each source's projections were published within the **preceding 7 days** (stale or undated sources are excluded).
2. Fresh sources are written to `tools/sources/<source>.json` (schema documented at the top of `tools/merge-projections.mjs`).
3. `node tools/merge-projections.mjs` merges them: multi-source stats are **averaged**, players are matched by normalized name+position against the existing `PROJECTIONS` roster (no adds/removes), and hard sanity checks abort on any anomaly (count change, NaN, implausible leaders, <25 matches, worker parse failure). Zero fresh sources → exit 2, no changes.
**League tailoring:** the app persists a compact sheet snapshot to localStorage (`iron_tuna_values_v1`: name/pos/$value/points + teams/budget/format) whenever `baseValued` recomputes. `/my-insights` reads it and translates each premium insight's percentage effect into the buyer's units — auction: dollars against the player's sheet price; snake/best ball: draft slots (and rounds) by re-ranking the snapshot. No snapshot → generic percentages plus a set-up-your-league hint.

4. On success it bumps `PROJ_VERSION` in `index.html` (date-stamped). Users with saved state re-baseline on next load; users who **reordered rankings** get an in-app prompt — "Use updated rankings" (clears `rankOrder`) or "Keep my reorder" (overlay persists on the new numbers).
5. The agent commits and pushes to `main` (Cloudflare auto-deploys).

Fail-safe: if fetching is blocked (environment network policy) or all sources are stale, the day is skipped with no repo changes. `tools/` is in `.assetsignore` so it never serves publicly.

## 10. X (Twitter) auto-post (added July 2026)

Posts to **@irontunafantasy** every **weekday at 14:00 UTC** (10am ET / 9am during EST) — one auction insight + one snake insight per run, **plus a third bonus post Tue/Wed/Thu**: Wednesday alternates auction money-allocation strategy and Value Coach promos, Tuesday+Thursday post snake-draft "survival odds" feature promos. Runs via a Cloudflare Worker **Cron Trigger**, no external scheduler needed.

**How it works:**
- `INSIGHTS_X_POOL` in `_worker.js` is a flat array of `{id, format, title, play, url, date}` extracted from the public `auction-insights-*.html` / `snake-insights-*.html` drop pages (140 insights: 70 auction + 70 snake). `play` is the insight-specific half of its "The play:" line (the generic strategy sentence is stripped, keeping just the actionable verdict). Regenerate with `node tools/extract-insight-pool.mjs` whenever new drop pages are added, then paste the resulting `tools/x-posts/insights_pool.json` back into the `const INSIGHTS_X_POOL = [...]` line in `_worker.js` (no build step, so this is manual — see §2). The extractor drops `play` to `''` if it detects leaked non-prose content (a data-quality guard against the couple of source pages where table markup bled into a `<p class="playline">`).
- `composeThread(insight)` builds a **2-tweet thread**, not a single tweet, so real analysis fits: tweet 1 is `🏈 {title}` + `💡 {play takeaway}` (the actual substance); tweet 2 is a reply carrying **"Run your draft using the strongest, most advanced AI in fantasy football."** + the insight's canonical URL + format-specific hashtags (`#FantasyFootball #AuctionDraft #FFDraft` or `#FantasyFootball #SnakeDraft #FFDraft`). Max observed length across the full pool: 194 chars (tweet 1) / 139 chars (tweet 2), both comfortably under 280.
- `runXAutoPost(env)` picks the next auction insight and next snake insight by rotation index (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM x_posts WHERE format=?`), so all 70 insights per format post once before any repeat. Only insights whose page `date` has already unlocked (≤ today) are eligible. If the two picks happen to share the same headline (the public drop pages occasionally cover the same player from both formats), the snake pick is bumped to the next index so the two posts never look like accidental duplicates.
- `postThread(env, tweets)` posts tweet 1, then tweet 2 as a reply via `in_reply_to_tweet_id`, using `postTweet(env, text, replyToId)` → **OAuth 1.0a** (HMAC-SHA1) signed `POST https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets`, since free/basic X API tiers only support posting via OAuth 1.0a user context, not app-only bearer tokens.
- `scheduled(event, env, ctx)` at the bottom of `_worker.js` calls `runXAutoPost(env)`, which posts both formats' threads and logs each attempt to a D1 table `x_posts (insight_id, format, tweet_id, ok, posted_at)` — `tweet_id` is a comma-joined pair (hook,reply) when both post successfully.
- **Tue/Wed/Thu bonus third post:** `X_BONUS_DAY_POOLS` maps UTC day-of-week → `{pool, compose, format}`.
  - **Wednesday** (day 3) uses `X_WEDNESDAY_POOL`, a 3-way interleave of: `X_STRATEGY_POSTS` (8 tweets on auction budget allocation — position spend %, stars-and-scrubs vs balanced, nomination timing, the $1 endgame/handcuffs — grounded in `/auction-budget-allocation`, `/auction-nomination-strategy`, `/dollar-endgame-handcuffs`), `X_COACH_POSTS` (7 tweets promoting the live AI Value Coach — "an AI that's actually in your draft" vs. pasting your roster into a generic chatbot), and `X_COMPARISON_AUCTION_POSTS` (4 tweets contrasting Iron Tuna's one-time $9.99 + live re-pricing + Value Coach against free-but-static default host draft kits (ESPN/Yahoo) and paid monthly ranking subscriptions like FantasyPros MVP, $5.99+/mo).
  - **Tuesday and Thursday** (days 2 and 4) both use `X_SNAKE_BONUS_POOL`, a 2-way interleave of `X_SNAKE_FEATURE_POSTS` (8 tweets promoting the live survival-odds / "Will he be available?" feature — knowing who'll last to round 5 changes what you take in round 2) and `X_COMPARISON_SNAKE_POSTS` (4 tweets contrasting the same live survival-odds/Value Coach/pricing angle against free static draft rooms (Sleeper/ESPN) and paid subscription rankers). Both days share one rotation counter (format `snakefeature`), so Tue and Thu together cycle through all 12 without repeating.
  - `runXAutoPost` looks up `X_BONUS_DAY_POOLS[dayOfWeek]` and, if present, posts one additional thread from that day's pool via `composeBonusThread(post, hashtags)` (shared tagline, day-specific hashtags — `#...AuctionDraft...` for Wednesday, `#...SnakeDraft...` for Tue/Thu). To test any day's bonus post outside its real weekday, call the manual trigger with `&day=<0-6>` (0=Sun..6=Sat, matches cron numbering) — `&wednesday=1` still works as shorthand for `&day=3`.
  - Competitor pricing referenced in the comparison posts (FantasyPros MVP ~$5.99/mo) was spot-checked via web search at authoring time (July 2026) — re-verify before reusing if it's been a while, since subscription pricing changes.
- **Manual trigger for testing:** `GET /api/admin/x-post-now?key=<LEADS_EXPORT_KEY>` runs the same `runXAutoPost` on demand and returns the composed thread text + tweet IDs — use this to verify before waiting for the next cron tick. Add `&day=2` (Tue), `&day=3` (Wed), or `&day=4` (Thu) to force that day's bonus post on an off-day test run.
- **Manual delete (cleanup):** `GET /api/admin/x-delete?key=<LEADS_EXPORT_KEY>&id=<tweet_id>` deletes a single tweet by ID via OAuth 1.0a `DELETE /2/tweets/:id` — useful for removing a bad test post.
- **Duplicate-text guard:** X rejects (`403 duplicate content`) any tweet whose text exactly matches one already posted from the account — forever, not just same-day, and a few insights share identical headline+takeaway text on both their auction and snake drop pages. `x_posts.text_hash` (SHA-256 of the hook tweet, added after the table's initial creation — `ALTER TABLE x_posts ADD COLUMN text_hash TEXT`) records every successful post; `pickNonDuplicate()` walks the rotation forward past any pool item whose composed text already has a matching hash before posting. Applies to all three pools (auction, snake, wednesday).

**One-time setup required (not yet done as of this handoff):**

1. **Create an X Developer app for @irontunafantasy** at [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com) (a paid API tier is required for write access on current X API pricing — check current tier pricing before committing). Enable **OAuth 1.0a** with **Read and Write** permissions, and generate:
   - API Key & Secret (`X_API_KEY` / `X_API_SECRET`)
   - Access Token & Secret **for the @irontunafantasy account specifically** (`X_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`) — regenerate these after setting Read+Write, since tokens generated before that change stay read-only.
2. **Add all four as Cloudflare secrets** on the `iron-tuna` Worker (`wrangler secret put X_API_KEY`, etc., or via the dashboard → Settings → Variables and Secrets → encrypt).
3. **Create the `x_posts` D1 table** (already run against `iron-tuna-leads` as of this handoff — included here for reference / disaster recovery):
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS x_posts (
     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
     insight_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     format TEXT NOT NULL,
     tweet_id TEXT,
     ok INTEGER NOT NULL,
     posted_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
     text_hash TEXT
   );
   ```
   Run via `wrangler d1 execute iron-tuna-leads --remote --command "..."` (the SQL above) or the Cloudflare dashboard's D1 console.
4. **Deploy** (`git push` to `main`, or `wrangler deploy` — the cron trigger only takes effect after a deploy since it's declared in `wrangler.jsonc`).
5. **Verify** with the manual-trigger route above before trusting the schedule.

**Notes:**
- If the four `X_*` secrets aren't set, `runXAutoPost` returns `{ok:false, error:'missing_x_credentials'}` and posts nothing — safe to deploy before the X app is ready.
- To change cadence/time, edit the `triggers.crons` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`; to change hashtags/tagline, edit `X_TAGLINE` / `X_HASHTAGS` in `_worker.js`.
- To draw from the 150-insight premium set instead of the public 70, a teaser/truncation strategy would be needed (premium content is currently paywalled behind `/my-insights`) — not implemented, by design, so free X posts don't give away paid-tier value.
